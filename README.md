# SmartMapAndroid
This is the android project for getting the bachelor's degree in systems engineering.
This project is an android app that uses unity as a library and allows the users from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana to trace routes between buildings.
The App also identifies the different building from the campus, providing information as names, images, spaces and amount of people at that time.
Concepts and tools: Kotlin, Unity, activities, fragments, jetpack compose for UI, room database for saving data locally, retrofit, MVVM, coroutines.
